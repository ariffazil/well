# WELL — Human Substrate & Metabolic State

> **Status:** OPERATIONAL | **Organ:** SUBSTRATE (Ω-WELL) | **Authority:** arifOS
> **Domain:** `well.arif-fazil.com`

## 🏛️ What this repo is

The human bio-telemetry and metabolic state organ within the arifOS federation. WELL monitors the coupled human-machine system state through a FastMCP surface of ~60 tools spanning biometric readiness, machine substrate telemetry, and coupled vitality metrics. All WELL data passes through the F5 PEACE and F6 EMPATHY floors before being used in any governance decision.

**WELL owns the SUBSTRATE — the living layer that keeps the human in the loop.**

> **MCP Surface (live test 2026-05-17):** 15 tools — `mcp_health_check` + 14 Ω-WELL tools. Source has 81 `@mcp.tool` decorators; only 15 exposed on public surface. Internal aliases (well_state, well_log, well_readiness, etc.) are hidden from MCP surface.

## 📦 Ownership

- **Owns**: Human biometric readiness (H-WELL), machine substrate telemetry (M-WELL), coupled vitality state (C-WELL), governance telemetry (G-WELL).
- **Does NOT own**: Constitutional judgment (arifOS), economic logic (WEALTH).
