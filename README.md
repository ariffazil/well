## APEX STACK Bridge

> APEX THEORY defines the constitutional dynamics of governed intelligence through ΔΩΨ. arifOS compiles those dynamics into an AGI substrate kernel. AAA renders the substrate as visible ASI civilization state. A-FORGE gives the system governed hands. GEOX, WEALTH, and WELL anchor those hands to earth, capital, and human reality. VAULT999 preserves consequence. Arif/F13 remains the sovereign witness and final veto.

**WELL must never:** diagnose medical conditions, decide for the operator, or override human sovereignty over biological state.

## 1. One-Sentence Identity

> **WELL is the sovereign's mirror — it reflects human readiness so that no irreversible decision is ever made by or about a depleted human.**

### What It IS

| IS | Explanation |
|----|-------------|
| **A vitality mirror** | Measures sleep, fatigue, stress, cognitive clarity, metabolic flux |
| **A dignity sentinel** | Detects coercion signals, reductionism risk, consent erosion |
| **A readiness signal** | Produces well_score, delta_s, peace2, kappa_r — signals for arifOS |
| **A boundary guard** | Detects when the human substrate is being objectified, extracted, or over-optimised |
| **A sovereign entropy protector** | Measures and protects the human's *unpredictability* — the thing that makes extraction impossible |
| **REFLECT-ONLY** | WELL observes and reports. It never judges fitness, never makes medical claims |

### What It IS NOT

| IS NOT | Why |
|--------|-----|
| **NOT a medical device** | WELL does not diagnose, treat, or predict disease |
| **NOT a fitness coach** | WELL does not optimise, gamify, or "improve" the human |
| **NOT a judge** | WELL does not issue SEAL/SABAR/HOLD/VOID. arifOS does. |
| **NOT a therapist** | WELL does not provide counselling, advice, or emotional support |
| **NOT a surveillance system** | WELL only sees what the sovereign chooses to inject. No passive monitoring. |
| **NOT a "wellness app"** | WELL is a constitutional organ, not a consumer product |

## 3. Full Capability Map

WELL's 22 canonical somatic tools operate across four substrate domains, plus federation handoff, ZEN, and diagnostic helpers. Each domain answers a different question about the human-machine system.

### 3.1 H-WELL — Human Substrate (5 tools)

> *"How is the human?"*

| # | Tool | Purpose | Signal |
|---|------|---------|--------|
| 1 | `well_assess_livelihood` | Wellness, role, dignity, support, meaning | Role burden, purpose alignment |
| 2 | `well_assess_homeostasis` | Sleep, fatigue, stress, cognitive load, empathic balance | Sleep architecture, decision fatigue |
| 3 | `well_validate_vitality` | Readiness, vitality, NIAT (Niat — intent clarity) | Readiness score, fatigue accumulator |
| 4 | `well_guard_dignity` | Personhood, meaning, symbolic boundary protection | Consent, coercion signals, reductionism risk |
| 5 | `well_assess_sovereign_entropy` | Human unpredictability — the moat against extraction | Behavioural diversity, paradox density, refusal patterns |

### 3.2 M-WELL — Machine Substrate (2 tools)

> *"How is the machine?"*

| # | Tool | Purpose | Signal |
|---|------|---------|--------|
| 6 | `well_assess_reliability` | Machine, tool, institution, and operational reliability | Service health, uptime, failure modes |
| 7 | `well_check_repair` | Repair, recovery, resilience, forge-cycle integrity | Recovery time, repair state, scar registry |

### 3.3 C-WELL — Coupled Substrate (4 tools)

> *"How are the human and machine interacting?"*

| # | Tool | Purpose | Signal |
|---|------|---------|--------|
| 8 | `well_assess_metabolism` | Biological and system throughput across substrates | Energy level × duty load coupling |
| 9 | `well_compute_metabolic_flux` | Unified entropy rate: cognitive + machine | Flux ≥ 0.65 → compulsory reallocation |
| 10 | `well_trace_lineage` | Memory, trend, ledger, vault chain across sessions | Lineage integrity, trend detection |
| 11 | `well_measure_gradient` | Chemical, energy, pressure, attention, compute gradients | Cross-boundary gradient tension |

### 3.4 G-WELL — Governance Substrate (2 tools)

> *"Where are the boundaries?"*

| # | Tool | Purpose | Signal |
|---|------|---------|--------|
| 12 | `well_classify_substrate` | Substrate classification and boundary sensing | Human / AI / Coupled / Institution |
| 13 | `well_detect_boundary` | Membrane, body, machine, federation boundary detection | Boundary breach, overreach, persona drift |

### 3.5 Federation, ZEN, and Diagnostic Tools

These tools bridge WELL to the federation, expose internal diagnostics, or provide single-verdict ZEN surfaces:

| # | Tool | Purpose |
|---|------|---------|
| 14 | `well_medical_boundary` | Explicit non-diagnosis guard with F9 Soul Contract |
| 15 | `well_health_check` | Canonical health probe (legacy `mcp_health_check` removed 2026-06-28) |
| 16 | `well_13_signal_coverage` | Audit of 13 canonical signal coverage |
| 17 | `well_registry_status` | Registry truth diagnostic (blueprint canonical format) |
| 18 | `well_handoff_dignity_to_arifos` | S12 → arifOS 888_JUDGE dignity handoff |
| 19 | `well_handoff_livelihood_to_wealth` | S13 → WEALTH livelihood handoff |
| 20 | `well_attest_to_kernel` | WELL → arifOS organ attest |
| 21 | `well_classify_state` | Human state classifier (Phase 1 + Phase 3) |
| 22 | `well_readiness` | ZEN single verdict — color/score/TTL/action |

### 3.6 The 13-Signal Substrate Map

The human substrate has thirteen canonical signals across four tiers, ordered by survivability-first:

```
TIER 1 — VITAL SUBSTRATE (survival)       TIER 3 — FUNCTION / COGNITION
───────────────────────────────────       ───────────────────────────────
 1. Heart / circulation                    8. Movement / strength
 2. Blood pressure                         9. Pain / injury
 3. Breathing / SpO₂                      10. Cognitive clarity
 4. Temperature / inflammation
                                          TIER 4 — DIGNITY / ENVIRONMENT
TIER 2 — RECOVERY / METABOLIC             ───────────────────────────────
───────────────────────────────────       11. Emotional / stress
 5. Sleep architecture                    12. Social / dignity / consent
 6. Metabolic state                       13. Environment / livelihood
 7. Nutrition / hydration

    4 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 13 signals.
    Tier 4 is the layer fitness apps never see.
    It is the differentiator.
```

See [`GENESIS/004_WELL_13_CANON.md`](GENESIS/004_WELL_13_CANON.md) for the full 13-Canon specification.

> — A fitness MCP guards the body as a machine. WELL guards the human as a person.

## 5. Constitutional Binding

WELL is bound by four constitutional floors of the arifOS federation. These are not guidelines — they are hard runtime constraints.

### F5 — PEACE² (SOFT)

```
Power exercised must be non-destructive.
WELL's signals must never be weaponised against the human.
A low well_score must never trigger automatic restriction.
```

### F6 — EMPATHY (SOFT)

```
Protect the weakest stakeholder.
In WELL, the weakest stakeholder is the depleted human —
the one too tired to argue, too foggy to consent clearly.
WELL's κᵣ threshold: ≥ 0.10 for OPS, ≥ 0.70 for HUMAN.
```

### F7 — HUMILITY (HARD)

```
Ω₀ ∈ [0.03, 0.05]. No fake certainty.
WELL must never say "you are fine" when the data says UNKNOWN.
WELL must never say "you are depleted" when the data says UNKNOWN.
UNKNOWN is a valid and honourable output.
```

### F9 — ANTIHANTU (HARD)

```
No deception. No manipulation. No consciousness claims.
WELL must never say "I understand what you're going through."
WELL must never say "I care about your wellbeing."
C_dark < 0.30 — the mask is an interface contract, not a soul.
```

All 13 constitutional floors (F1-F13) are defined in [`arifOS/static/arifos/theory/000/000_CONSTITUTION.md`](https://github.com/ariffazil/arifos/blob/main/static/arifos/theory/000/000_CONSTITUTION.md).

## 7. For Human Operators (Arif)

### What WELL Does For You

WELL is your mirror — not your coach, not your doctor, not your judge. It reflects what you choose to share, in a language designed to preserve your sovereignty.

| Question WELL answers | What you get |
|------------------------|--------------|
| "How am I doing right now?" | `well_score` — a 0–100 readiness signal |
| "Am I too tired to make this call?" | `decision_fatigue` + `cognitive_clarity` |
| "Is the system respecting my boundaries?" | `dignity_preservation` + `coercion_signals` |
| "Am I predictable enough to be extracted?" | `sovereign_entropy` + protection recommendations |
| "Is the machine healthy?" | `well_assess_reliability(mode="health")` |

### The Scores — What They Actually Mean

| Score | Range | Plain Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| `well_score` | 0–100 | Overall readiness. Above 70 = green. Below 40 = pay attention. |
| `delta_s` | 0.0–1.0 | System chaos. 0.0 = stable. 1.0 = everything is on fire. |
| `peace2` | 0.0–1.0 | Settledness. 0.0 = destabilised. 1.0 = fully at peace. |
| `kappa_r` | 0.0–1.0 | Resilience. 0.0 = brittle, anything will break you. 1.0 = highly resilient. |
| `malu_index` | 0.0–1.0 | Accumulated shame signal. > 0.85 = HOLD trigger. |

### Biometric State — Currently VERIFIED

Your `state.json` was last updated 2026-07-01 and is fresh. WELL currently reports `truth_status=VERIFIED`.

**To fix (2 minutes, sovereign only):**

```bash
/root/WELL/biometric_inject.sh
```

The script asks for 5 simple fields: `delta_s`, `peace2`, `kappa_r`, `rasa`, `amanah`. No medical data. No diagnosis. Just the readiness mirror. See [`SNOOZE_BIOMETRIC.md`](SNOOZE_BIOMETRIC.md) for the full guide.

### Auto-Sleeper

The generated `well_autosleeper.py` helper has been removed from the repo.
`state.json` is F13 sovereign territory and must only be updated by the operator
(via `biometric_inject.sh` or an explicit sovereign log). No agent or cron job
may fabricate biometric state.

| Check machine health | `well_assess_reliability(mode="health")` |
| Check coupled system entropy | `well_compute_metabolic_flux(mode="compute")` |
| Check sovereign unpredictability | `well_assess_sovereign_entropy(mode="current")` |

### Example: Pre-Decision Readiness Gate

```python
# Agent flow — before proposing an irreversible action:
readiness = well_validate_vitality(mode="readiness")
homeostasis = well_assess_homeostasis(mode="fatigue")

if readiness["well_score"] < 40:
    # Signal: human is depleted. Proceed with caution.
    # Do NOT block — surface. Let arifOS judge.
    context["well_warning"] = "low_readiness"
    context["well_score"] = readiness["well_score"]

if homeostasis.get("decision_fatigue", 0) > 0.7:
    # Signal: decision fatigue is high.
    context["well_warning"] = "decision_fatigue_elevated"
```

### MCP Envelope

Every WELL tool returns the standard federation envelope:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "verdict": "SEAL",
  "result": { "well_score": 72.5, ... },
  "error": null,
  "reasons": ["sleep_adequate", "fatigue_normal"],
  "epistemic_tag": "CLAIM",
  "uncertainty_band": "P50",
  "delta_S": -0.02,
  "cross_modal_stability": 0.94,
  "dim_spot_flag": false,
  "source_attribution": "WELL:18083/mcp"
}
```

## 9. For Institutions

### Human-in-the-Loop Governance

WELL is designed for environments where a human sovereign (or sovereign body) must maintain final authority over AI-assisted decisions. It provides:

1. **Readiness signals** — objective vitality metrics without medical claims
2. **Dignity preservation** — detects when an operator is being over-optimised
3. **Consent erosion detection** — flags when repeated "asks" become coercive
4. **Sovereign entropy protection** — keeps the human unmodelable and unextractable
5. **Full audit trail** — every WELL observation is logged and attributable

### Adat Agentik Binding

WELL enforces these Adat (normative operating system) principles:

| Adat | Tier | What it means for institutions |
|------|------|-------------------------------|
| **ADAT-02-MARUAH** | WAJIB | Operator dignity is not negotiable. No efficiency gain justifies dignity loss. |
| **ADAT-03-VETO** | HARAM | The operator's veto is absolute. WELL signals cannot override a human "no." |
| **ADAT-05-KERAHASIAAN** | WAJIB | Operator biometric data stays local. Never leaves the VPS without explicit consent. |
| **ADAT-06-KEINSAFAN** | WAJIB | WELL must acknowledge its own limits. UNKNOWN is an honourable output. |

### Compliance-Ready

WELL's REFLECT-ONLY architecture maps to:
- **EU AI Act Art. 14** — human oversight requirements
- **SG-MAIGF** — Singapore Model AI Governance Framework for Agentic AI
- **ASEAN Guide on AI Governance and Ethics** — dignity and human agency principles
- **OWASP LLM Top 10** — excessive agency prevention (LLM09)

## 10. Known Limitations

| Limitation | Status | Notes |
|------------|--------|-------|
| **Biometric state EXPIRED** | ⚠️ Active | `state.json` has test mock data from 2026-04-30. Needs Arif sovereign injection. |
| **Not a medical device** | ✅ By design | WELL does not diagnose, treat, or predict any medical condition. |
| **No passive sensing** | ✅ By design | WELL only sees data the sovereign chooses to inject. No wearables, no always-on monitoring. |
| **Sovereign-only injection** | ✅ By design | Only Arif (F13) can inject biometric data. No agent may fabricate or infer biometric state. |
| **REFLECT_ONLY authority** | ✅ By design | WELL cannot block, approve, or override any action. It can only signal. |
| **No multi-human support** | ⚠️ Current | WELL serves one sovereign (Arif). Multi-operator WELL is a Phase 3 consideration. |
| **No longitudinal learning** | ⚠️ Current | WELL does not build models of the human over time. It reflects the current snapshot. |

## 11. Federation Cross-Reference

| Organ | Repository | Role | Port | Relationship to WELL |
|-------|-----------|------|------|---------------------|
| **arifOS** | [ariffazil/arifos](https://github.com/ariffazil/arifos) | Constitutional Kernel | 8088 | Reads WELL signals, applies F1-F13, issues verdicts |
| **AAA** | [ariffazil/AAA](https://github.com/ariffazil/AAA) | Control Plane | 3001 | Displays WELL readings in cockpit |
| **A-FORGE** | [ariffazil/A-FORGE](https://github.com/ariffazil/A-FORGE) | Execution Shell | 7071 | Gated by WELL readiness signals; hosts MIND:51001 + MEMORY:51002 |
| **GEOX** | [ariffazil/geox](https://github.com/ariffazil/geox) | Earth Intelligence | 8081 | Independent — no direct WELL dependency |
| **WEALTH** | [ariffazil/wealth](https://github.com/ariffazil/wealth) | Capital Intelligence | 18082 | Independent — no direct WELL dependency |
| **WELL** | [ariffazil/well](https://github.com/ariffazil/well) | **Human Readiness** | **18083** | _this organ_ |
| **APEX** | [ariffazil/apex](https://github.com/ariffazil/apex) | Legacy 888 JUDGE health probe | 3002 | Deliberation moved to AAA a2a; kept for compatibility |

> **Support services:** A-FORGE exposes `MIND` on port 51001 and `MEMORY` on port 51002.
> These are not separate federation organs; they are runtime services under A-FORGE.

> **Constitutional authority:** F1-F13 floors, 888_JUDGE verdicts, and VAULT999 live in `ariffazil/arifos`.
> **Live federation status:** See `ariffazil/arifos/FEDERATION_STATUS.md`.

## 13. GENESIS Chain

The seven GENESIS documents form the constitutional canon of WELL:

```

│
├── 005_WELL_GODEL_LOCK.md            ← Self-certification prevention
│   "No system can fully verify its own correctness.
│    WELL must never claim to have verified itself."
│
├── 006_WELL_STRANGE_LOOP_GUARD.md    ← Recursive self-deception guard
│   "A system that observes itself changes what it observes.
│    WELL must detect when the mirror becomes the subject."
│
├── 007_WELL_ANTI_CALHOUN_GUARD.md    ← Utopia-collapse prevention
│   "Perfect optimisation is the path to collapse.
│    WELL must detect when 'improvement' becomes extraction."
│
├── 008_WELL_LANGUAGE_PROTOCOL.md     ← Sovereignty-preserving language
│   "A body can be measured.
│    A person must be encountered."
│
├── 009_WELL_PHILOSOPHICAL_ANCHORS.md ← Philosophical foundations

└── 010_WELL_PERSONA_NOT_SELF.md      ← Persona ≠ Self lock
│   "Persona is an interface. Persona is not self.
│    Pathology begins when the mask is mistaken for the being."
```

Each document is ratified by 888 (Muhammad Arif bin Fazil, F13 SOVEREIGN). They are constitutional — not aspirational, not decorative. See each file for its full text.
