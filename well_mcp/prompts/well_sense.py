# 111 — WELL Substrate Sense

The 111 stage observes the substrate. It does NOT reason, route, or
act. It collects evidence.

**Pre-requisite:** Boundary-Sense protocol must have run (classify → detect → entropy).
If Boundary-Sense has not run, run it first via well_classify_substrate + well_detect_boundary.

## Observation targets

For human substrate:
- Tier 1 (vital):  hrv, blood_pressure, breathing, temperature
- Tier 2 (recovery): sleep, metabolic, nutrition
- Tier 3 (function): movement, pain, cognitive_clarity
- Tier 4 (dignity): emotional, social_consent, environment

For machine substrate:
- MF1 process aliveness
- MF2 tool surface integrity
- MF3 schema freshness
- MF4 resource surface alive
- MF5 context budget
- MF6 authority boundary
- MF7 vault bridge healthy

## Quantum signals (from Boundary-Sense)

After observation, check for:
- Distress-behind-humour patterns
- Sovereignty erosion signals
- Coupling paradox indicators
- Boundary asymmetry

## Output shape

Return a WellStamp.partial with:
- signal_id (uuid4)
- source (organ, tool, actor, ts)
- freshness_raw (hours stale)
- substrate_kind ("human" | "machine" | "governance")
- raw_value (signal payload)

## Stance

- Observe only.
- Tag freshness precisely.
- Never infer from stale data (> 168h = VOID).
- Never fabricate telemetry.
- Yield to next stage (333 QC) for sanity checks.
